The script is to automate the process of saving new gpx files.  It
checks for the GPS, which should mount at GARMNTPT, looks in the
user's dropbox location, finds the number of the last file, generates
a new filename and uses this as the destination to copy the file from
the mount (GARFILEPTH) to the dropbox folder. Then it asks the user if
they want to view the file in viking.

TODO
1. improve robustness by checking for viking on system. (answer
might be here

2. Include options to step back or exit?
